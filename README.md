# my_flix_app

My first attempt at a simple Android app called MyFlix. It makes calls to the unofficial Netflix Global Search API to do tasks such as searching through the database, parsing that data, and storing specific shows and movies. There is a registration / login system that was made using Firebase Authentication and the whole app is using the Flutter Firebase techstack.
